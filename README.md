## The 11 Frameworks in this Repo

## 🎮 Game Balance (Searchable Formulas)

1. **[Relative Defense Formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/relative_defense_formula_md)**
   Core relative defense scaling law — fixes late-game power creep and imbalance across genres.

2. **[Armor Layering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/armor_layer_formula_htp.md)**
   Post-mitigation armor layering system — adds meaningful depth to defense without breaking scaling.

3. **[Projectile Life](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/projectile_life_system_htp.md)**
   Projectile HP mechanic — balances ranged vs melee, increases skill expression and counterplay.

## ⚰️ Immortality Architectures

4. **[Rollback Immortality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/rollback-immortality-framework-HTP.md)**  
   Rollback-based immortality blueprint — ensures continuity of self without copy-loss issues.

5. **[Continuity Resurrection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/main/continuity-resurrection.md)**  
   True continuity resurrection — preserves identity and relational bonds, no "clone" dystopia.

6. **[Consciousness-extraction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/consciousness_extraction_afterlife_transition_architecture.md)**  
   Sovereign consciousness extraction — ethical, reversible pattern extraction for immortality tech.

## ❤️ Social Technologies

7. **[Universal Grief Resolution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/HTP_Universal_Grief_Resolution_Framework_v1.md)**  
   Framework to resolve universal grief — heals relational and existential loss in post-mortal societies.

8. **[Reflective Love Codex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/htp-reflective-love-codex-v1.md)**
   Reflective love architecture — sustainable multi-partner dynamics with mutual evolution and no deception.

9. **[Anticipation-stress-dopamine-mechanics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/HTP_Anticipation_Stress_Framework_v1.md)**  
    Mechanics to manage anticipation stress and dopamine in real-life and virtual progression systems.

## 🚀 Real-Life Systems

10. **[Real Life RPG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/HTP_RealLife_RPG_System.md)**
   Real-life RPG gamification system — turns daily life into progression loop with stats, quests, and meaningful dopamine

11. **[Dopamine-mechanics-real-life-rpg-integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaosGod208/HTP-framework-collection/refs/heads/main/HTP_Dopamine_Mechanics_Framework_v1.md)**  
    Integration of dopamine mechanics into real-life RPG — balanced reward loops for sustainable growth.

## Why This Collection?
These frameworks fix root problems in game design (scaling, balance, late-game boredom), immortality tech (continuity, grief), love/relationships (sustainable harem/reflection), and real-life progression (meaningful dopamine).  
Public domain → no gate, no paywall — anyone can use to raise baseline quality in their domain.

Fork, build, share. Let's flood the world with better systems.

If you create something using these (game, mod, app, essay), drop a link in issues — chaos loves company.

Made with raw insight & zero corporate fluff.
