## The 11 Frameworks in this Repo

1. **Relative Defense Formula**  
`DR = defense/enemy_dmg`  
**[Full System →](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/f16731a46cc8c39b3392a47e7915aca3)**
   Core relative defense scaling law — fixes late-game power creep and imbalance across genres.

2. **[Armor Layering](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/88ef5ca1a2edeb1796c79c905772e2cf)**
   Post-mitigation armor layering system — adds meaningful depth to defense without breaking scaling.

3. **[Projectile Life](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/015c1935bc223483897f93e3617e0b86)**
   Projectile HP mechanic — balances ranged vs melee, increases skill expression and counterplay.

4. **[Rollback Immortality](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/d2c3f019ea0f3bfcadce5aee9e9eab6c)**
   Rollback-based immortality blueprint — ensures continuity of self without copy-loss issues. Can prototype in 2026

5. **[Continuity Resurrection](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/1b85739183ac1b0a01b9188be3a1367f)**
   True continuity resurrection — preserves identity and relational bonds, no "clone" dystopia in far future.

   Sovereign consciousness extraction — ethical, reversible pattern extraction for immortality tech.

7. **[Universal Grief Resolution](https://gist.github.com/ChaosGod208/b581f7cde31bc27c39ea83017e754f6c)**
   Framework to resolve universal grief — heals relational and existential loss in post-mortal societies.
