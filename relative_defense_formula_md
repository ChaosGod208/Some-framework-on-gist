Relative Defense Formula (HTP)

A simple universal defense formula for RPGs.

---

Formula

DR = Defense / Enemy dmg (max 80% DR, can increase through passive/trait/class/...)

Or

Damage taken = Enemy dmg × (1 - Defense/Enemy dmg)
Clamp DR between 0% and 80%.
(No minimum DR. Only maximum DR.)

Ex:

  Early Game Example
- Mob ATK: 50  
- Boss ATK: 80  
- Player DEF: 20  

  Scene 1 - Normal Attack (100% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Normal: deal 50 dmg → DR = 20 / 50 = 40% → Dmg taken = 30
- Boss Normal: deal 80 dmg → DR = 20 / 80 = 25% → Dmg taken = 60 

 Scene 2 - Ultimate Skill (200% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Ultimate: deal 100 dmg → DR = 20 / 100 = 20% → Dmg taken = 80 
- Boss Ultimate: deal 160 dmg → DR = 20 / 160 = 12.5% → Dmg taken = 140 

  Mid Game Example
- Mob ATK: 500  
- Boss ATK: 800  
- Player DEF: 300  

  Scene 1 - Normal Attack (100% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Normal: deal 500 dmg → DR = 300 / 500 = 60% → Dmg taken = 200  
- Boss Normal: deal 800 dmg → DR = 300 / 800 = 37.5% → Dmg taken = 500 

  Scene 2 - Ultimate Skill (200% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Ultimate: deal 1000 dmg → DR = 300 / 1000 = 30% → Dmg taken = 700  
- Boss Ultimate: deal 1600 dmg → DR = 300 / 1600 = 18.75% → Dmg taken = 1296 

  Late Game Example
- Mob ATK: 5000  
- Boss ATK: 8000  
- Player DEF: 4000  

  Scene 1 - Normal Attack (100% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Normal: deal 5000 dmg → DR = 4000 / 5000 =  80% → Dmg taken = 1000  
- Boss Normal: deal 8000 dmg → DR = 4000 / 8000 = 50% → Dmg taken = 4000  

  Scene 2 - Ultimate Skill (200% ATK multiplier):  
- Mob Ultimate: deal 10000 dmg → DR = 4000 / 10000 = 40% → Dmg taken = 6000 
- Boss Ultimate: deal 16000 dmg → DR = 4000 / 16000 = 25% → Dmg taken = 12000 

Notes

Defense scales relatively to Enemy dmg.
Fixes the common RPG problem where defense becomes useless late-game.
Works for RPG / ARPG / MMO / MOBA / Shooter (armor) / Strategy.
Add armor as a second layer if needed.
